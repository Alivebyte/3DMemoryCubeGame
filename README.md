Simple 3D memory cube game made approximately about 4 days. 
The rules are simple:
You have 10 seconds to remember each color of the 4 cubes on the scene, then, you have 60 seconds to pick the right colors.  After you pick the color to the cube, you can't no longer pick the color for the same cube, you need to pick the color for the next cube. If you manage to pick the right colors, then you win, if you picked the wrong colors on any cube, then you lose and the game start again. The cube order start from the most left cube.  Unfortuantely, I couldn't make any sort of indication of what cube is currently chosen for picking colors, so choose colors wisely.  Although the game doesn't have any sort of progression or penalties, so you can try picking colors multiple times as you want.
The controls are simple:
WASD - move around the camera,

Left and Right Arrow Keys - pick colors. 

â€‹Enter - confirm the color for selected cube and move to the next one.

There is a slight issue when you pick the color and move to the next cube the previos cube's color applies to the next one. Don't worry, you can still pick the colors by using arrow keys.
